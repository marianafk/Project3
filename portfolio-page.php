			<h3>Wordpress Website</h3>
			<h4>Description:</h4>
			<p>This was our lab 11. The purpose of this lab was to practice installing and using a very well known Content Management System. We had to be able to install it in our local machine using MAMP/WAMP, and then we had to move it to a production web server. To be able to see how our website looked, we had to add some random posts, comments, etc. We also had to add widgets and different elements to make it more interesting. I really enjoyed adding extra contect to my page, like the pictures that are displayed in the carousel.</p>

			<h3>Using a framework</h3>
			<h4>Description:</h4>
			<p>For this lab, we had to use some starter files and change the entire CSS code to be able to display the information in a completely different way. We had to understand the framework we wanted to use to be able to apply the necessary CSS and design the website in the way we wanted to. I really enjoyed working on this assignment, mainly because I got to see a different design for that website that we have used too many times in this course and in 170 :). I really liked the design I came up with, it was very clean.</p>

			<h3>Scrolly Website</h3>
			<h4>Description:</h4>
			<p>For this assignment, we had to pair up and design a very long scrolly website with 3 different sections. The sections had to demonstrate different pattern of design to show information in very different ways. I thought this project was very challenging, not because of having to work with another person, but because of the patterns we had to follow. It was hard to apply the necessary CSS to be able to show the information the way we wanted to. I think the easiest part was to design the section that contained our information.</p>

			<h3>First Lab</h3>
			<h4>Description:</h4>
			<p>I had so much fun working on this assignment. I thought it was great to be able to put any content I wanted to and give it a weird and different design. The thing I like about this lab is that we worked on it at the beginning of the semester, I can't believe it's that long since I had to design it. I love hedgehogs as you can see by the picture, it was fun to find cute pictures of them. Another thing I liked about this lab was that the design didn't have to be very complex, we could make it our own in very simple ways.</p>

			<h3>New York City</h3>
			<h4>Description:</h4>
			<p>This assignment was a great challenge. We had to look at a webiste, get the starter files and apply the necessary CSS to be able to replicate what we could see in a picture. We had to make sure everything looked the same way, the background, the columns, the table at the bottom. It was so much fun! The only thing I didn't like was that I became too perfectionist at some point, and I wanted to make sure every single pixel in my website looked as the one in the picture, I probably spent more than 5 hours working on all the details.</p>

			<h3>Fixing the code</h3>
			<h4>Description:</h4>
			<p>For this lab, we had to work on starter files provided by the professor. We had to use php includes to be able to separate file that was being repeated too many times across the website, like the navigation bar, or the footer. We also had to fix all the links that were included on the file so that they would redirect the user to the correct page, or at least so that they wouldn't get an error. The last thing we had to do was find a way to show the user the current page, in other words, the page that they were visiting in the nav bar.</p>
