		<h3>USTA Ladies League</h3>
		<img src=images/league.jpg alt="Playing the league">
		<p>This semester, I was able to join a tennis league for women with one of my best friends. We got to play more than 6 matches and helped the team become one of the top 2 in the league. We're still waiting to play the last match. The greatest part about this achievement was that we were not doing it for ourselves, we were helping our friends because they had some spots open on their team, and they needed people to play. It turned out to be a great experience for us, we even plan our weekends around it. We would always go together, take a quick shower, and then go have dinner as a reward.</p>

		<h4>Gingerbread Cookies</h4>
		<div id="part3">
			<p>Last week was the first time I made gingerbread cookies. My friend Lauren and I had a hard time decorating each and one of the 50 cookies we ended up making. The start was rough, the first 5 gingerbread man we decorated didn't look happy at all. But at the end we were proud of the results.</p>

		<h4>Mary Hosking Invitational</h4>
			<p>At the beginning of this semester, I won an individual tennis tournament when my team and I went to William Smith College, it was our first tournament of the fall season. Another one of my teammates got to win her flight too. Our coaches were very happy with our results.<p>

		<h4>My first iOS app</h4>

			<h3>Tennis</h3>
			<p>I have been playing tennis since I was 8 years old. But my greatest achievement in this sport has been earning my spot to play for the varisty tennis team in the University of Rochester. This achievement gave me also my closest friends since the beginning of college. I started playing my Freshmen year, but decided to take a break to focus on school during my Junior year. Now, I'm back as a senior, ready to finish strong. I'm excited to see what the spring season brings.</p>

			<h3>My First Job</h3>
			<p>During my first summer here in The United States, I got to be a Resident Advisor at Brown University. I was able to interact with kids that were still in high school, but that wanted to have the experience of living in a dorm, and having classes just like a normal college student. We got to spend time with all of them, have lunch, take them to trips, and show them what life in college is all about. They were very nervous and shy at the beginning, but they all left with a smile on their face. It was a great experience, and a great acheivement for me.</p>

			<h3>Constellation Brands Inc.</h3>
			<p>Last summer, I applied for an internship in Constellation Brands Inc. and was able to experience working as a full time employee in an office. I even got to travel for work to Mexico. It was definitely hard to get used to the entire work environment, but at the end I was very happy working with all the managers in my team, they even asked me to stay for the fall semester, and now, I will be staying with them for another 4 months during the spring semester.</p>

			<h3>My Car</h3>
			<p>After getting the job with CBI, I realized I had to buy a car to be able to go to work. I was going to work 5 days a week, and a cab wasn't an option. For that reason, I decided to spend most of the money I had saved on a car. Henry is the first car I buy with my own money. It felt great to know that it was something I earned by myself. Of course I had help from my best friends, but the money came from my pocket. I feel like buying Henry has been one of the greatest achievements in my life.</p>
